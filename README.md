ai health monitoring
 AI-Powered Health Monitoring System Overview
This project is an **AI-powered health monitoring system** that collects data from wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches, fitness trackers), detects anomalies, and provides personalized health insights.  
It aligns with **UN SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-being)** and **SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).**

 Features
- Real-time health monitoring (Heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, Activity levels)
- AI-driven anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, LSTM for time-series)
- Personalized health recommendations
- User-friendly app (Flask/React Native prototype)
- Cloud-ready deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)
